 # Screenzee
**An amazing app built by using React, Redux, Scss...!**
 
 Screenzy is the best movie app. Front-end technologies like React, Redux, and SCSS. By building this app I learned basic concepts of react js like jsx, components, props, state, component lifecycle, conditional rendering, lists, keys, and redux, I created more complex logics in javascript to make our react application can be made super interactive and beautiful. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
